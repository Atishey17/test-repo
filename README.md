# Project Synopsis: AI-Powered ATS Resume Shortlister and Score Teller System

## Problem Statement
Human resource departments and recruiters face challenges in efficiently processing large volumes of resumes and identifying the most suitable candidates for job openings. Manual resume screening is time-consuming, prone to bias, and may overlook qualified candidates.

## Proposed Solution
Develop an advanced Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that leverages pre-defined machine learning models to automate the resume shortlisting process and provide accurate candidate scoring. The system will streamline the initial stages of recruitment, enhancing efficiency and objectivity in candidate selection.

## Key Features
1. Automated resume parsing and information extraction
2. AI-driven matching of resumes to job descriptions
3. Intelligent shortlisting of candidates based on predefined criteria
4. Quantitative scoring of candidates' suitability for positions
5. User-friendly interface for recruiters to review results

## Technology Stack
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for resume and job description analysis
- Pre-defined machine learning models for candidate evaluation
- Scalable database for storing and retrieving application data
- Web-based front-end for user interaction

## Expected Outcomes
1. Significant reduction in time spent on initial resume screening
2. Improved quality of shortlisted candidates
3. Consistent and bias-reduced evaluation of applicants
4. Data-driven insights into the applicant pool and hiring process

## Project Impact
This AI-powered ATS will revolutionize the recruitment process by enhancing efficiency, reducing human bias, and enabling recruiters to focus on high-value tasks such as interviewing and candidate engagement. The system aims to improve the overall quality of hires while reducing time-to-fill for open positions.
